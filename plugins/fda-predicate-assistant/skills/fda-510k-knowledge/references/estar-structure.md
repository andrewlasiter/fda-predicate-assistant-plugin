# eSTAR Submission Structure Reference

## eSTAR Overview

The FDA's eSTAR (electronic Submission Template and Resource) organizes 510(k) submissions into standardized sections.

> **Mandatory filing requirement:** eSTAR is mandatory for all 510(k) submissions received on or after **October 1, 2023** (per section 3503 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023). Submissions not using eSTAR format will be refused.

### eSTAR Format
- eSTAR is a **fillable PDF form** (not a document template) — download from [FDA eSTAR page](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/electronic-submission-template-and-resource-estar)
- Current version: eSTAR 5.6+ (check FDA website for latest version)
- Attachments must follow naming conventions: `Section##_AttachmentName.pdf` (e.g., `Section06_DeviceDescription.pdf`)
- Maximum individual file size: 100 MB; use sequential numbering for multiple attachments per section
- All attached documents should be text-searchable PDF (not scanned images)

### Administrative Section
- **Accession Number**: Assigned by FDA upon receipt — leave blank in initial submission
- **FDA Tracking Number**: Auto-generated by FDA document control
- **Submission Type**: Traditional 510(k), Special 510(k), Abbreviated 510(k), or De Novo
- **Previous Submission Numbers**: Reference any prior related submissions (Pre-Sub Q-numbers, prior 510(k)s)
