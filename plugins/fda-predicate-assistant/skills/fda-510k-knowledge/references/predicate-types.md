# Predicate Device Selection Guide

## What Makes a Valid Predicate?

A predicate device must be:
1. **Legally marketed** in the US (cleared, approved, or pre-amendments)
2. **Not subject to PMA** (i.e., Class I or II, or pre-amendments Class III)
3. **Has the same intended use** as your device
4. **Has same technological characteristics** OR different technology that doesn't raise new questions

## Predicate Strategies

### Single Predicate Strategy

**When to use:**
- Your device is very similar to an existing device
- Same intended use and technology
- Clear path to substantial equivalence

**Advantages:**
- Simplest review
- Clearest comparison
- Fastest clearance

**Example:**
> Device A (new pulse oximeter) cites Device B (cleared pulse oximeter)
> Same technology, same intended use, minor improvements

### Multiple Predicate Strategy

**When to use:**
- No single device covers all aspects
- Different features from different predicates
- Technology combines multiple approaches

**Considerations:**
- Must justify each predicate's relevance
- Combined predicates must cover entire device
- More complex review

**Example:**
> Device A (combination monitor) cites:
> - Device B for blood pressure measurement
> - Device C for pulse oximetry
> - Device D for temperature sensing

### Split Predicate Strategy

**When to use:**
- Intended use from one device
- Technological characteristics from another
- Neither device alone is sufficient

**Requirements:**
- Clear explanation of split
- Both predicates legally marketed
- Combination doesn't create new risks

**Example:**
> Device A (new surgical tool) cites:
> - Device B for intended use (same surgical procedure)
> - Device C for technology (same mechanism of action)

### Reference Predicate (Different from Primary)

**When to use:**
- Primary predicate establishes equivalence
- Reference devices provide supporting data
- Comparison to state of the art

**Important:**
- Reference ≠ predicate for equivalence
- Reference supports safety/effectiveness claims
- Must clearly distinguish roles

## Predicate vs. Reference Device

| Aspect | Predicate | Reference |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Purpose | Establish substantial equivalence | Provide comparison data |
| Requirements | Same intended use | May have different use |
| Role in 510(k) | Mandatory comparison | Optional support |
| Regulatory status | Must be legally marketed | Should be marketed |
| Labeling impact | Defines your intended use | No direct impact |

## Choosing the Best Predicate

### Factors to Consider

1. **Recency**
   - Recent predicates preferred
   - Shows current state of technology
   - Less likely to be obsolete

2. **Similarity**
   - More similar = easier comparison
   - Same product code preferred
   - Same manufacturer helpful

3. **Clearance History**
   - Clean regulatory history
   - No recalls or safety issues
   - Well-documented decision

4. **Data Availability**
   - Public summary available
   - Performance data accessible
   - Testing standards known

### Red Flags in Predicate Selection

- **Recalled predicates**: Avoid if possible
- **Very old predicates**: May raise questions
- **Class III predicates**: Generally not valid
- **Foreign-only devices**: Not legally marketed in US
- **Pending devices**: Not yet cleared

## Special Situations

### Pre-Amendments Devices

Devices marketed before May 28, 1976:
- No 510(k) clearance number
- Still valid predicates
- Include grandfather devices

### De Novo Devices

Devices cleared through De Novo:
- Create new classification
- Valid predicates for future 510(k)s
- Check regulation number

### Combination Products

Products with drug/device/biologic:
- Complex predicate selection
- May need multiple pathways
- FDA combination office jurisdiction

## Common Predicate Issues

### Predicate Chain Length

Long chains (A→B→C→D→...→Z):
- Each link must be valid
- Technology may have evolved significantly
- FDA scrutinizes long chains

### Predicate Drift

When predicates are dissimilar:
- Current device very different from original
- "Substantial equivalence" questioned
- May need different pathway

### Missing Predicates

When no predicate exists:
- Consider De Novo pathway
- Check international clearances
- Evaluate Class III PMA

## Documentation Tips

1. **Cite specific K-numbers**: K240717, not "similar devices"
2. **Explain selection rationale**: Why this predicate?
3. **Address differences**: Acknowledge and justify
4. **Provide comparison tables**: Side-by-side features
5. **Include equivalence summary**: Clear substantial equivalence statement
